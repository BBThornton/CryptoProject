- Is a distributed ledger governed by a central body any better than a database?
  - If you trust the entity adding information to the ledger don't you also inherently trust that the entity wont change the data in the ledger.
  - Is there scope to have the ability for anyone to become a full node which just detects If/when the ledger changes.
- Does proof of work also stop tampering even if the blockchain is stored centrally. As in order for the blockchain to be edited all the has values will still need to be recomputed.
