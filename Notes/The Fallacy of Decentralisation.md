# The Fallacy of Decentralisation
Note Created: 2022-02-25
[[Centralisation is Inevitable]]

Decentralisation is on of the primary goal of current blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies, many proposing that decentralisation is the key to it eventual success, circumventing regulation and providing anonymity. Although this is likely true it is, in fact, incredibly unlikely that true decentralisation is possible in practice. Many of the consensus algorithms that are used to facilitate decentralised operation tend towards the patterns of pre-existing centralised institutions and with wiping the current banking systems off of the face of the planet it is unlikely and unpractical for blockchain technologies to reach fully decentralised status.

# Conways Law
```
Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.
```
I propose that the architecture of many blockchain (namely their consensus algorithms) follow a form of conways Law, tending towards a design which mirrors modern day financial systems. Take **Proof of work** for example, when a new blockchain using proof of work is made public it works "well" (ignoring the potential cold start security problems), it allows any user to partake in the mining process, at reasonable cost due to the low mining difficulty. However once the userbase of the blockchain grows and the value of the coin increases the cost of partaking in the mining process also increases. For those that started mining early this is not a problem as they can reinvest some of the coins (which have now greatly increased in value) into more processing power to continue to partake in the mining process. However for new users this increased cost of entry poses a significant hurdle to decentralisation.

Now in order to partake in the "decentralised" mining process new miners must fund their mining endeavours using money made using traditional financial systems (work). This increase in investment increases the speculative value of the coin and thus increases its value. This of course directly benefits the early adopters. Early adopters are the only ones that benefit from cryptocurrency mining (at least from a from a financial standpoint), *is this in any way different to the centralised systems that already exist?*.
## mining pools
This Mining difficulty problem forces users to join mining pools centralising the mining effort into corporations that can silently sensor transitions that are added to the chain. This re-centralisation of the mining power poses a huge threat for the decentralised usability of cryptocurrency.

## The Authority
Furthermore many Cryptocurrencies are managed by boards/organisations of individuals whom determine how the chain should be managed, when rollbacks should occur and which new policies should be implemented. This centralised control structure determines the nature of the chain as a whole, and disagreements between these members have lead to hard forks in the past, splitting the chain into multiple avenues. This further demonstrates that blockchains are not truly decentralised and are, in fact, no dissimilar to cash money.

## Blockchains are just cash with extra steps
Cash money is simple, its value and usability is governed by a group of individuals (The bank of England), you retrieve cash from a central authority (the bank branch) or from individuals (cash in hand), and then can spend it in a decentralised manner (at a shop). This is identical to current crypto systems. The bank is the board in charge of the blockchain, the branch is a crypto-exchange, 

Ultimately the rich get richer, early adopters win out and the chain and mining process is forced to undergo re-centralisation just to support its own popularity and user base. Cryptocurrencies are forced to grow their user base to be valuable but ultimately this undermines the value of the technology in the first place.
