# Personhood
Proving that a user of a decentralised system is one person and that one person can only exist on the network as one entity. 
A one to one relation between digital identity and physical entity.

# Methods
## Central Authority
User auth through a central authority, i.e. email, Government ID etc.
Problem is that this role often has to be passed to another authority in order to do the check.

## Proof of Biometrics
Premise is that users use a biometric signature during account creation. For example fingerprint readers in their phone. This fingerprint data is then hased and stored (connected to their account). Then if they attempt to create a new user they cant as their print is already in the system.

**Problems:** 
- biometric data is "creatable" fingerprints can be generated by bot software. (Although the skill requirements are higher than traditional botting)
- Users have 10 fingerprints
