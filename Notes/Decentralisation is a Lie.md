# In proof of work
## Mining pools
- Decentralisation cannot be guaranteed due to the cost associated with feasible mining.
- This forces users that want to get involved to function as skinny nodes (without the full ledger) and instead join a mining pool.
  - Centralising the mining process
## Wealthy entities
- Are able to compete more aggressively and thus have more control over the network

## Developers always maintain control
- The developers always maintain an amount of control of the system able to do rollbacks/forks. 

## In order to cashout you need to go through an exchange
- Unless cryptocurrency is adopted widely the only way to buy things with crypto is to convert crypto to fiat currency. 
- The only way to do this is through an exchanged (many of which are centralised)
