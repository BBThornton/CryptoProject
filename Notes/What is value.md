# What is value
[[Theoretical Question]]
Note Created: 2022-01-28

The value of Crypto is all speculative
Bottom of the [monero infrastructure documentation](https://monerodocs.org/infrastructure/networks/) sums it up
```
If mainnet and stagenet are technically equivalent then why only mainnet coins have value?

This is simply the convention community embraced. Value only comes from a shared believe that mainnet coins will be accepted by other people in the future.
```

Does anything have an inherent value?
Is the value a property that can actually be measured?
Is all value speculative?
