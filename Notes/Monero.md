# Monero
Note Created: 2022-03-03
A Cryptocurrency commonly used for browser based mining. 
The current plan is to fork the monero source code and adapt to support the new crypto currency.

## Monero Systems Setup (How Monero Works)

## RandomX - Restricting WebBased mining
Monero adopted RandomX as a method of reducing web based mining hijacks. [[Random x limiations]]

## Mining Monero using Source Code
[[Building Monero From Source Code]]

## Mining Pool
[[Building Monero Pool Written In C]]

## Monero Testnet - Equivalent to a private blockchain

## Adapting Monero into a new blockchain
Monero is a fork of [[CryptoNote]] (which I believe isn't supported anymore)
Therefore the instruction (that were likely followed when setting up Monero) can also be followed to adapt the Monero code to a custom blockchain. [[Forking and deploying cryptonote]]
