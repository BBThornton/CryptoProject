# Project premise recap
To recap I am proposing a system which is able to utilise cryptocurrency mining as a form of content monetisation.
The system will allow users to mine cryptocurrency whilst consuming digital content.
This is preferable to current methods of monetisation such as subscription, ad or freemium models
Not only because 
- It avoid the privacy violations that are currently effecting ad based models 
- But also avoid the problems faced by freemium models which rely on building a critical mass of users (whilst operating at a loss) before providing paid for services
The system is also able to provide open traceability of content ownership, accurate association of content consumption and the contents popularity, and more direct monetisation whilst also ensuring an open content nature.
However in order to provide such a system a few key hurdles of the current cryptocurrency & blockchain eco system must be overcome.

# The Issues

- Current cryptocurrency and block chain system that rely on proof of work do not induce an ecosystem that can be used for this project proposed system.
- Mining difficulty has increased drastically due to the current popularity of the cryptocurrency space
- This increased difficulty has increased the hardware requirements of the mining system with only extremely powerful (and thus expensive) hardware able to actively compete in the mining process.
- This increased cost of entry poses a significant hurdle to cryptocurrency mining as a content monetisation method.

# Centralised & Equalised
- In order to overcome this I propose a centralised blockchain which rewards all miners equally reducing the hardware requirements of proof of work
- This system works by allowing users to mine the blockchain by entering into a centralised mining pool. The mining pool manages the consensus of the blockchain centrally.
  *CLICK*
- The mining pool functions by allowing users to submit shares (which are solutions to a mining problem with a lower difficulty than the actual mining problem of the blockchain)
- By removing the requirement for consensus it allows the system to reward all users equally regardless of the number of shares an given user mines in the pool. Thus allowing a threshold number of shares to be used, where by any number of users that meet the threshold will be eligible for the reward whilst also being able to stop mining once the threshold has been reached.
- *CLICK*
-  this reduces the hardware requirements of the mining process as users are not competing but just trying to reach the required share threshold.

# Reward Distribution
Rewards are then given to the content creators based on the number of miners that reach the threshold limit whilst watching their content.
A fixed arbritary amount of coins can be rewarded 

# System Architecture 
The proposed system functions by having users mine cryptocurrency as they consume digital content.
This mining process generates cryptocurrency directly for the content creator. The mining process is managed by a mining pool which allows any number of users to join the process.
This pool allows the system to both directly reward the creators of the content being consumed but also can be used to determine what content is most popular based on the number of miners.

# Hurdles


# benefits
The system I am proposing provides several key benefits acting as an
- Alternative method of monetisation which is able to directly rewarding creators
- whist also openly measuring the utilisation of digital resources based on the amount of "work that is performed"
- Openly attribute work to different open source resources









# Hurdles
Volatility, hardware inequality, Reliance on hardware
